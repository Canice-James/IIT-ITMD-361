    <h2>LAB 1 - So.. you want to know about me?</h2>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p> Salutations, you've reached the "get to know me" of Canice James from the island of Antigua. I'm truly estatic to be a part of this course! 
        Since as a child I've had a deep interest in web development and web design. However, because of how flexible web technologies and languages can be it tend to be difficult to learn the best practices 
        and get a solid foundation of understanding with just Youtube tutorials and article. Thus, programme will to help to build a stronger set of skills as a web developer/ designer.
